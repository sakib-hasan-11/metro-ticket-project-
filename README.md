METRO TICKETING SYSTEM – PYTHON PROJECT

1. BACKGROUND

---

In Bangladesh, buying metro tickets is still a manual process. This causes long queues, wasted time, and mistakes.
To solve this, I created a simple Python-based Metro Ticketing System that helps users:

• Buy single or multiple metro tickets easily  
• Cancel tickets with partial refunds  
• Generate QR codes for ticket verification

2. DATA STRUCTURE

---

The project is written in Python and uses the following libraries:

• pandas – to handle and store ticket data in CSV format  
• qrcode – to generate QR codes  
• os and datetime – to manage file paths and generate unique ticket IDs

The program flow includes:

• Taking user input for name, phone number, and stations  
• Calculating the cost based on station distance  
• Generating a ticket ID and QR code  
• Saving ticket info into a CSV file  
• Allowing ticket cancellation with an 80% refund

3. SUMMARY

---

Key Features:

• Terminal-based interface for ticket purchasing  
• Single and multiple ticket options  
• QR code generation  
• Ticket cancellation with refund  
• Data saved in a CSV file

Real-World Benefits:

• Helps avoid manual errors and save time  
• Simple prototype for real metro station ticketing  
• Promotes digital solutions for local transport
